this is a first draft for wrapping the vensim dll in a pythonic way

by default it is assumed the dll is readily available. If this generates an 
VensimError, you have to find the location of the dll and either copy it to
C:\Windows\System32 and/or C:\Windows\SysWOW64, or use::

    vensim = ctypes.windll.LoadLibrary('location of dll')

Typically, the dll can be found in ../AppData/Local/Vensim/vendll32.dll
