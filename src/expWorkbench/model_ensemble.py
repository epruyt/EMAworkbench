        .. rubric:: suggested use
        
        In general, analysis scripts require both the structured array of the 
        experiments and the dictionary of arrays containing the results. The 
        recommended use is the following::
        
        >>> results = ensemble.perform_experiments(10000) #recommended use
        >>> experiments, output = ensemble.perform_experiments(10000) 
        
        The latter option will work fine, but most analysis scripts require 
        to wrap it up into a tuple again::
        
        >>> data = (experiments, output)
        
        Another reason for the recommended use is that you can save this tuple
        directly::
        
        >>> import expWorkbench.util as util
        >>> util.save_results(results, filename)
          
        .. note:: The current implementation has a hard coded limit to the 
          number of designs possible. This is set to 50.000 designs.

          a higher value.
